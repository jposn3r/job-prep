At GTC 2026, Cosmos 3 unified synthetic world generation with action simulation.

It's a TPM role (not EM), but the core competencies — cross-team coordination, translating technical work into clear communication, driving delivery in ambiguous environments — map directly to your EM skill set. The domain (3D, animation, generative AI, digital humans) connects to your Meta Reality Labs spatial computing experience. The lower comp range makes it potentially a step down financially, but L5 range ($200K-$322K) is competitive and the domain alignment is strong.",
